    **WARNING: Please read the restrictions below carefully.**

    If you do not follow it, **your submission will not be graded.**

    1. Do not use keyword `var`. Use `val` and `def` instead.
    2. Do not use any library functions or data structures like `List`, `Array` `Range` (`1 to n`, `1 until n` ...),
       `fold`, `map`, `reduce` or etc... You can only use tuples, `scala.annotation.tailrec`, and
       `scala.util.control.TailCalls._` from the library.

    Again, if you do not follow these rules, your score will be zero.

    For all three problems, 50% of the test cases will require tail call optimizations (ie, have large inputs)
    and the other 50% will not (ie, have small inputs).

    So, we will get 50% of the score if you submit a correct program without tail call optimization.

   Exercise 1: Collatz sequence

   Consider this function: for a positive integer n,
   f(n) = n / 2       (if n is even)
   f(n) = 3 * n + 1   (if n is odd)

   Collatz sequence is defined as follows:
   c_0 = n  (n is positive integer)
   c_k = f(c_(k-1))

   Collatz conjecture(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) is the famous open problem,
   that no matter what value of starting value 'n', the sequence will always reach 1.

   Given a number n (1 <= n <= 10^12), compute the length and the sum of collatz sequence
   starting with n, until it reaches 1.

   e.g.) collatz(5) == (6, 36)
         (5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1)

   Exercise 2: Definite integral by Riemann sum

   Implement definite integral:
   Given a continuous function f, and range [a, b], compute the definite integral value over the interval [a, b]

   The value should be calculated by Riemann sum. (https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=2073839&cid=47324&categoryId=47324)
   Divide the interval [a, b] into n equal intervals, and gather the areas below function f through each interval.

   The difference between your result and the real integral value should be less than 0.001

   Hint: Double `n` until the value moves less then 0.001

   Addition 10/04: Assume that the difference with a Riemann sum and a real integral value will always be less than 0.001 when n >= 10^7

   Exercise 3: Ping-pong Ackermann function

   Given a function p and positive integer a and b, implement this function `ppa`: (0 <= a, b <= 10^6)
   ppa(p, a, b) = p(a, b)               (if a <= 0 or b <= 0)
   ppa(p, a, b) = p(a, ppa(p, a-1, b))  (if p(a, b) is even and a, b > 0)
   ppa(p, a, b) = p(ppa(p, a, b-1), b)  (if p(a, b) is odd and a, b > 0)


   Hint 1: If a, b > 0, wrap remained calculations, make it as an anonymous function and pass it to the parameter recursively.
           That anonymous function is called 'Continuation'. You'd better search 'Continuation Passing Style'.

   Hint 2: Due to the limits of Scala's platform (JVM), tail call (not tail recursion) is not optimized generally,
           especially when using continuation passing style.
           To optimize tail call properly, use `tailcall`, `done`, `result` functions from scala.util.control.TailCalls._
